= Project Backlog
:order: 4

Now that we have covered everything that we need to know, you can practise your skills by implementing the remainder of the backlog.
There is still functionality to be added to the genre listings, movie listings and people directory.

This module will be slightly different from the previous one.

Instead of an in-depth explanation, you will only be provided with the type of transaction and a Cypher statement.
It will then be up to you to use your knowledge to complete the challenge.

If you get stuck at any point, you can reveal the solution under the *Working Solution* header.
You can also checkout the relevant branch from the repository at any time.

**Let's go!**
